# Registeration-form
This project is a simple registration form built with HTML, CSS, and Node.js, storing user information in a MongoDB database. The form allows users to sign up with their name, email, and password, which is then securely stored in the MongoDB database. The project utilizes Node.js as the server-side language, handling form submissions and interacting with the MongoDB database using the Mongoose library. The front-end is built with HTML and CSS, providing a clean and intuitive user interface. This project demonstrates a basic example of user registration and data storage using a MEAN (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js) stack.
